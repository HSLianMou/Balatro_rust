>When design the joker like JollyJoker etc which need to have pair or Straight that will work to add the mult and chips, 
I use a Vec named work_joker_cards_in_hand, and then I forget some joker will not use but have edition, 
the foil, holographic and polychrome also need to be calculate, that cause me so confuse when autotest the stage03

>When design the Baron Joker, I faced the mult*1.5 will be work after calculate all other joker cards, 
however, the Baron should be calculate first, after you finish the card played's calculate, 
Baron will be the priority, then the other jokers should start to calculate.
